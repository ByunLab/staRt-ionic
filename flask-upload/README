An upload test server, to verify that file uploads from the app are working correctly

Before you run the server, to set up the python environment, do:

virtualenv /tmp/srvr
source /tmp/srvr/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

Then, to run the server, just do
python application.py

Which will start listening for POST requests on localhost:5000

To end the virtual environment, after closing the server, just run

deactivate
